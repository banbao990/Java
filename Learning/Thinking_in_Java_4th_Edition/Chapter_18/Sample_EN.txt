1. If you shed tears when you miss the sun, you also miss the stars.
2. My heart, the bird of the wilderness, has found its sky in your eyes.
3. It is the tears of the earth that keep her smiles in bloom.
4. What you are you do not see, what you see is your shadow.
5. The waterfall sing, "I find my song, when I find my freedom."
6. You smiled and talked to me of nothing and I felt that for this I had been waiting long.
7. Man does not reveal himself in his history, he struggles up through it.
8. Like the meeting of the seagulls and the waves we meet and come near.The seagulls fly off, the waves roll away and we depart.
9. We come nearest to the great when we are great in humility.
10. Never be afraid of the moments--thus sings the voice of the everlasting.
11. The perfect decks itself in beauty for the love of the Imperfect.
12. Wrong cannot afford defeat but right can.
13. In my solitude of heart I feel the sigh of this widowed evening veiled with mist and rain.
14. We read the world wrong and say that it deceives us.
15. Man barricades against himself.
16. Let life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like autumn leaves.
17. I think of other ages that floated upon the stream of life and love and death and are forgotten, and I feel the freedom of passing away.
18. Do not linger to gather flowers to keep them, but walk on,for flowers will keep themselves blooming all your way.
19. Thoughts pass in my mind like flocks of lucks in the sky.I hear the voice of their wings.
20. Who drives me forward like fate? The Myself striding on my back.
21. Our desire lends the colours of the rainbow to the mere mists and vapours of life.
